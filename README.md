# Demos
This is a simple layout of a web page where some action is performed through buttons. There are four buttons on left side of the page each one of
it makes the font size bigger of the main screen text by diffrent sizes. Plus there is a code for throttling so any request dont work if they 
are made within 2 sec interval.
I had problem with providing border to the sidebar and mainscreen as they both dont stay on the same line after border is applied. Any 
help for this would be welcomed.
